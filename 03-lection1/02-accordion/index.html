                     HTML elements are positioned static by default.
                     Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
                     An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
                 </p>
            </details>
            <details class="accordion__item">
                 <summary class = 'accordion__title'>
                     Position absolute
                 </summary>
                 <p class = "accordion__content">
                     An element with position: absolute; is positioned
                     relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):
                 </p>
            </details>
            <details class="accordion__item">

                 <p class = "accordion__content">
                     An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
                     Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
                 </p>
